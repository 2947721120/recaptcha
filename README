This plugin adds helpers for the ReCAPTCHA API (http://recaptcha.net/). In your views you can use
the +recaptcha_tags+ method to embed the needed javascript, and you can validate in your controllers
with +verify_recaptcha+.

You'll want to add your public and private API keys in the environment variables RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY
and RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY, respectively. You could also specify them in config/environment.rb if you
are so inclined.

== +recaptcha_tags+

Some of the options available:

<tt>:ssl</tt>:: Uses secure http for captcha widget (default +false+)
<tt>:noscript</tt>:: Include <noscript> content (default +true+)

== +verify_recaptcha+

This method returns +true+ or +false+ after processing the parameters from the ReCAPTCHA widget. Why
isn't this a model validation? Because that violates MVC. Use can use it like this, or how ever you like. Passing in the ActiveRecord object is optional, if you do--and the captcha fails to
verify--an error will be added to the object for you to use.

	respond_to do |format|
	  if verify_recaptcha(@post) && @post.save
	    # ...
	  else
	    # ...
	  end
	end
	
== TODO
* Add some helpers to use in before_filter and what not
* Add support for themes and tabindex
* Better documentation
